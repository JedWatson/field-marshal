# Field Marshal

Field Marshal is a way to co-ordinate and administer jobs across multiple machines. It relies on git and utilises a declarative style to specify what should be running and how many of them there should be.

Field Marshal is designed to work with [Cavalry](https://github.com/davidbanham/cavalry) and is a rewrite of [Rear Admiral](https://github.com/PinionTech/rear-admiral).
